We can check what's at a particular Array index.

    // Print out what's in indexes 7, 10, and 3.
    System.out.println(dvdCollection[7]);
    System.out.println(dvdCollection[10]);
    System.out.println(dvdCollection[3]);

    // Will print:

    // The Avengers, directed by Joss Whedon, released in 2012
    // null
    // Star Wars, directed by George Lucas, released in 1977
    
IMPORTANT !!!!
Notice that because we haven't yet put anything at index 10, the value it contains is null. In other languages, such as C, the Array slot could contain completely random data. 
Java always initializes empty Array slots to null if the Array contains objects, or to default values if it contains primitive types. 
For example, the array int [] would contain the default value of 0 for each element, float[] would contain default values of 0.0, and bool[] would contain default values of false.
