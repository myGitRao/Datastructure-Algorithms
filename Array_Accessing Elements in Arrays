WRITING ELEMENTS INTO THE ARRAY::
To put a DVD into the Array, we need to decide which of the 15 places we'd like it to go in. Each of the places is identified using a number in the range of 0 to N - 1.
The 1st place is 0, the 2nd place is 1, the 3rd place is 2... all the way up to the 15th place, which is 14. 
We call these numbers that identify each place indexes.

EXAMPLE::
--> Let's put the DVD for The Avengers into the eighth place of the Array we created above.

    // Firstly, we need to actually create a DVD object for The Avengers.
    DVD avengersDVD = new DVD("The Avengers", 2012, "Joss Whedon");

    // Next, we'll put it into the 8th place of the Array. Remember, because we
    // started numbering from 0, the index we want is 7.
    dvdCollection[7] = avengersDVD;
 
 
--> And that's it. We've put the DVD for The Avengers into our Array! Let's put a few more DVD's in.

    DVD incrediblesDVD = new DVD("The Incredibles", 2004, "Brad Bird");
    DVD findingDoryDVD = new DVD("Finding Dory", 2016, "Andrew Stanton");
    DVD lionKingDVD = new DVD("The Lion King", 2019, "Jon Favreau");

    // Put "The Incredibles" into the 4th place: index 3.
    dvdCollection[3] = incrediblesDVD;

    // Put "Finding Dory" into the 10th place: index 9.
    dvdCollection[9] = findingDoryDVD;

    // Put "The Lion King" into the 3rd place: index 2.
    dvdCollection[2] = lionKingDVD;
    
 --> Notice that we put The Incredibles into the Array at index 3. What happens if we now run this next piece of code?
 
    DVD starWarsDVD = new DVD("Star Wars", 1977, "George Lucas");
    dvdCollection[3] = starWarsDVD;
    
    IMPORTANT !!!!
    Because we just put Star Wars into the Array at index 3, The Incredibles is no longer in the Array.
    It has been overwritten! If we still have the incrediblesDVD variable in scope, then the DVD still exists in the computer's memory. 
    If not though, it's totally gone!
