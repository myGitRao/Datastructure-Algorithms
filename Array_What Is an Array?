An Array is a collection of items. The items could be integers, strings, DVDs, games, booksâ€”anything really. 
The items are stored in neighboring (contiguous) memory locations. Because they're stored together, checking through the entire collection of items is straightforward.

So, how can we relate this back to the physical DVDs? Well, do you keep your DVDs all around the house in multiple locations? Hopefully not! 
Most people keep all of their DVDs right next to one another inside one gigantic box, or perhaps on a bookshelf. 
We do this so that if we need to find a particular DVD, we can quickly search through all of them without running from room to room.
